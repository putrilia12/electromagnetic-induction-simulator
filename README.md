# ⚡ Electromagnetic Induction Simulator

An interactive **Pygame-based simulation of electromagnetic induction** that demonstrates **Faraday’s Law** by allowing users to move a magnet through a coil, adjust coil parameters (such as length, diameter, and number of turns), and observe real-time changes in magnetic field, induced electromotive force, and light bulb intensity

## 🧪 Physics Concept

This simulation is based on **Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction**:

> A changing magnetic flux through a coil induces an electromotive force (EMF).

## 📐 Formulas Used

```text
Faraday's Law:
ε = -N (dΦ/dt)

Magnetic Flux:
Φ = B · A · cos(θ)

For this simulation:
θ = 0°
therefore:
Φ = B · A

Coil Area:
A = πr²

Numerical Approximation:
ε ≈ -N (ΔΦ/Δt)
```

### 🧠 Explanation

* Magnetic flux (Φ) is calculated from the magnetic field (B) and the coil area (A).
* When the magnet moves relative to the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil changes over time.
* This changing flux induces an electromotive force (EMF) according to Faraday’s Law.
* The induced EMF is then used to control the brightness of the light bulb using a sigmoid function for smoother visual representation.
